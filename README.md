Initiative Tracker Web Application
By Gabe Williams

This is a Web Application version of my Initiative Tracker app that I made in Python. 

To Use it: 
1). Go to this link (http://redwizard.pythonanywhere.com/)

2). Enter in a "combatant" via the three boxes

3). Select if you want the list to be sorted in descending (Checked) or ascending (Unchecked) order

4). Select if you want the sort to also consider modifers as a tiebreaker if the roll is the same

5). Hit 'Create Combatant' to add the combatant to the list!

6). Manage the list however you please! There is an edit function as well as a delete function 

If you need to exit the site for a moment it will remember you so long as you are on the same computer. After 24 hours it will clear your data and you will have to enter everything in again. 

If you have any problems please let me know and I'll get around to it!
