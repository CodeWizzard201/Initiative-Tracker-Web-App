<h1>Initiative Tracker</h1>
By: Gabe Williams
<br><br>
A Web Application that helps users keep track of their encounters in tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) with better flexibility for improved ease of use!

<h3>Motivation:</h3>
While playing TTRPGs with friends online, I noticed the client we used did not have a built-in initiative tracker which made combat much more painful as we had to keep track mentally, using a temporary text file, or using one of the other web-based initiative tracker applications online. I tried using those but I was frustrated with the inflexibility of them, needing either a login or if I needed to refresh the page, my list would immediately disappear. That is why this Initiative Tracker app uses Flask's built-in sessions to allow for a more flexible approach to keeping track of encounters!

<h3>Quick-Start:</h3> 
Go to the website! (https://redwizard.pythonanywhere.com/)

If you need to exit the site for a moment it will remember you so long as you are on the same computer. After 24 hours, it will clear your data, and you will have to enter everything in again. 

If you have any problems, please let me know, and I'll get around to it!
